# ComposeEnforcer
### Compose enforcer validates that a provided docker-compose file meets restrictions set.

It can be used via CLI from the compiled binary, or you can use the public interfaces
provided.

I am making no guarantees of API stability at this time.

Currently it supports:
  - volumes
  - networks
  - secrets
  - resources
